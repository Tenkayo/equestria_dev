############ MAIN TREE

######## Not Faction related
DED_Council:0 "The Dread Council's Decision"
DED_Council_desc:0 "The time has come once again to choose a leader for the current Dread League. Rosa Maledicta is the most promising candidate for this position. She has great ambition that matches her proficiency in dark magic. Truly, she will be the leader the Dread League needs."

DED_Army_Dead:0 "The Army of Dread"
DED_Army_Dead_desc:0 "Every army needs leaders. We should look into gathering the best tactical minds of the Dread League, their combined experience and their leadership qualities will serve us well in the coming years. The League will see their armies fight for the respect they deserve. "

DED_Prep_Crusade:0 "Prepare for the Dark Crusade"
DED_Prep_Crusade_desc:0 "My Queen, the Arcturian Order has persecuted us for years now. You may desire to manoeuvre the Dread League into the position of waging war with those vile worshippers of the light and bring an end to the reign of their petty order."

DED_Unquiet:0 "No Rest for the Undead"
DED_Unquiet_desc:0 "The Magehold is the main gathering for the denizens of the Dread League. This presents an opportunity to put some of its inhabitants to use. Manufactures will be built to provide for the requirements of Rosa and her armies. Plans for these industrial building have been drawn up by the Dread Leagues' most trusted architects, they simply await approval from Rosa Maledicta."

DED_Loyalty:0 "Undying Loyalty"
DED_Loyalty_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta herself is well versed in the dark arts of magic. To ensure the loyalty of her armies, she has cast a geas on them. This geas ensures that her armies, her generals, and some of her advisors are bound into loyalty unto her. The Dread League will be largely bound to her will."

##### Death of Light
DED_Unholy_War:0 "Mors Lucis"
DED_Unholy_War_desc:0 "For countless generations, the Dread League has been hounded and sieged by the fanatical Arcturian Order. Years of preparation has gone into preparing an army to overcome our obstacles and descend South. Declaring our intentions with the Order is the last step we need to take before our great crusade can start. To war!"

##### The end of all the lives
DED_Black_Crusade:0 "Finis Omnium Vitarum"
DED_Black_Crusade_desc:0 "The day has finally come. With the Arcturian Order lying in ashes and many of their former citizens now serving in our undead army, we can finally set our eyes on our true goal. The Crusade against all life and the installation of what Rosa Maledicta calls 'True Order'. The time has finally arrived to call forth the Dark Crusade! The world will fear the name of the Dread League!"

######## Society of Bones
DED_Soc_Bone:0 "Choose the Society of Bones"
DED_Soc_Bone_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is run by necromancers and liches. Siding with this faction will anger the Coven of Blood, but will grant us with the ability to raise large armies of skeletons and ghouls to reign terror upon the mortal nations." 

DED_Flesh_Bone:0 "Weak is the Flesh"
DED_Flesh_Bone_desc:0 "We have proposed repurposing the weak and frail within our borders to effective soldiers. The logic is sound, but our methods of doing so can be considered elegant. Those who suffered in life, serve unquestioningly in death."

DED_Work_Bone:0 "Work Them to the Bone"
DED_Work_Bone_desc:0 "Our cadavers need weapons! The Society will not sent their skeletons to fight without the proper armament of a modern army. Factories need to be built to supply our forces, to prepare for the grand crusade against life itself!"

DED_Nec_Off:0 "Order Amongst the Dead"
DED_Nec_Off_desc:0 "The Society of Bones wishes to lead their armies into war. With one of their strategically minded necromancers at the head of one of the Dread League's armies, they will be able to lead more competently than one who cannot use necromantic spells. If they had one of their own leading an army each, we will surely see an increase in overall performance."

DED_Adv_Skele:0 "Advanced Skeleton Adaptations"
DED_Adv_Skele_desc:0 "Skeletons are different to flesh and blood ponies, they have weaknesses that ponies simply lack. Establishing a institution within the Society of Bones with the sole purpose of designing solutions to these problems. It may even give those necromancers a small boost to their egos."

DED_Skele_Skin:0 "It lives Rosa! It lives!"
DED_Skele_Skin_desc:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures, the Society of Bones have realised this with recent internal developments concerning the Society. The grand undead army is not growing fast enough to match the growing conflicts in the world. The recently deceased shall be brought forth to bolster the armies and fuel Rosa' ambitions. The Societies' small council of liches"

DED_Skele_Armor:0 "Armoured Skeletons"
DED_Skele_Armor_desc:0 "Through the Society's efforts, most of our army is comprised of skeletons, with a smaller portion of it being zombies. Being versed in magic, some necromancers can offer their abilities to enhance specialized armour just for the skeletons. It won't be a perfect solution, but our forces will last longer on the battlefield."

DED_Skele_School:0 "Advanced Necromancy"
DED_Skele_School_desc:0 "The Society of Bones has been improving on their necromantic spells and abilities. These improvements have lead towards the skeletons having a limited innate ability to learn new things, unlike the previous method of applying spells to implant programmed tactics and actions into the skeletons."

DED_Skele_on_Skele:0 "A Marching Army"
DED_Skele_on_Skele_desc:0 "With our undead army gifted with a limited ability to learn new skills, we can finally begin to drill proper discipline into our troops. Gone are the days of large swarming hordes firing guns haphazardly and flailing swords around, the days of the coherent and intelligent undead army have come. The future bodes well for the Dread League and the Society of Bones."

DED_Skele_In_Plane:0 "Oh my, Flying Skeletons!"
DED_Skele_In_Plane_desc:0 "With the advancements of necromantic magic, skeletons are able to pilot vehicles as advanced as planes. To best take advantage of this, we will benefit from investing our resources in developing a new plane design just for the bones of our soon-to-be pilots. The skies will fall under the domain of the Dread League once more!"

DED_Spooky_Factory:0 "Exponential Necromancy"
DED_Spooky_Factory_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is getting very efficient with their spellcasting. Grand necromantic spells are being cast upon the land the Dread League has power over. As they are woven into the fabric of the land, great hordes of the ancient dead will rise. All ready to be integrated into Rosa's undead army. Necromancers will continue to weave this spell into new land if the dominion of the Dread League expands."

##### Life to Death
DED_Bone_Queen:0 "Vita ad Mortem"
DED_Bone_Queen_desc:0 "The Society of Bones is impressed by you Queen Rosa, but before they devote their undivided loyalty to you they request that you prove your devotion to the cause. To do this, you must forge a phylactery and ascend to lichdom. The Society speaks of the 'Chalice of Blood' and how it is the best way to create one. My Queen, this relic has been lost for countless centuries, and must be reclaimed."

######## Vampires
DED_Guild_Blood:0 "Choose the Coven of Blood"
DED_Guild_Blood_desc:0 "The Coven of Blood is run exclusively by vampires, most of these are ponies. These vampires will specialise turning the armies of the nation into a vampyric army supported by the elite few and their thralls. Siding with this faction will anger the Society of Bones."

DED_Lord_Lady_Death:0 "The Noble Dance of Death"
DED_Lord_Lady_Death_desc:0 "A unicorn stands surrounded. Armoured Griffin knights surround her, with a grin; she becomes a blur of pony and steel. She weaves and twirls around the squad of five with both natural elegance, and surprising ferocity. When she stops, the last knight falls to the ground, dead. "That was fun, I should have started doing this sooner, but a lady does not play with her food.""

DED_Sen_Livestock:0 "Sentient Livestock"
DED_Sen_Livestock_desc:0 "Mortals have a place below us vampires, those that don't have the privilege of becoming our feeding thralls, shall be put to use in our factories. Be it so feed the vampires we have working there, or to actually work there themselves, all shall serve us."

DED_Ed_Nob:0 "Educate the Nobles"
DED_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "The nobility form the very core of our society, whilst they may sometimes think themselves above it, they too have to work hard for their nation. The members of the nobility not put forth into combat shall henceforth study technology and doctrine; our vampyric nature should allow us to make great strides, whereas the mortals would struggle."

DED_Blood_Slave:0 "Bound by Blood"
DED_Blood_Slave_desc:0 "A higher level of obedience can be achieved through blood magic. Being vampires, we of the Coven of Blood have a natural disposition towards this kind of sorcery. Through blood magic, we can ensure our thralls are loyal and carry out our plans to their utmost ability. Only the strongest of wills will be able to resist our magic."

DED_New_Blood:0 "Welcome the Fledglings"
DED_New_Blood_desc:0 "Rosa Maledicta's vision puts our current population in a poor position. We must increase our numbers reap the rewards of their inclusion to our coven. We seek to conquer, but not all our conquests will involve thralls or blood cattle. Those we find useful will become a part of our Coven,"

DED_Vamp_Club:0 "The Vampire Elite"
DED_Vamp_Club_desc:0 "Whilst the Coven is run by the Vampire Nobility, there are two echelons, the lower, and the higher. With the castes properly defined, the lower nobility will go to war, whilst the higher nobility will work towards the betterment of the dread league through scholarship. They will still learn the ways of war, but through doctrine."

DED_Fact_Farm:0 "Industrialize the League"
DED_Fact_Farm_desc:0 "Let it be said that the Coven of Blood is above the uncultured ways of the Society of Bones. We recognise that even with all of our thralls and vampires be they fledglings or purebloods, will need weapons of war to fight our future enemies. We will establish factories to aid in the growth of our war machine."

DED_Food_Ed_Nob:0 "To Teach the Masters"
DED_Food_Ed_Nob_desc:0 "Unlike the times of old where technological changes were far and few between, it was the nobility of the Coven that taught their thralls to meet their requirements. In these coming times of war, it is the thralls and servants that teach us the modern ways of the world. Specifically how modern weapons work. Rosa Maledicta's plans will benefit us greatly."

DED_Blood_Elect:0 "To Elect Thine Leader"
DED_Blood_Elect_desc:0 "Whilst the Dread League may be run by Rosa Maledicta. The Coven has a loose political structure, defined by the two echelons of Nobility. With a newly instituted law, both levels of the nobility will be required to vote for a leader of the Coven. This would be not only to represent the Coven, but to lead them on most internal matters."

DED_Blood_Soil:0 "Cursed be Thine Intruder"
DED_Blood_Soil_desc:0 "The Coven despise intruders on their lands, they view them as sacred and holy. Only their thralls, themselves, and invited guests are permitted within the Coven's borders. To solve this abhorrent problem, the Coven will weave dark blood rituals into the land. The Dread League's land will be coated in vampyric spells, all of them designed to drain the life out of foreign invading armies."

##### The immortal blood
DED_Blood_Queen:0 "Sanguis Immortalis"
DED_Blood_Queen_desc:0 "The time has come at last Rosa Maledicta. You have consolidated your power and reformed the Dread League into a nation to be rightfully feared. However, tradition dictates that you must take the mantle of 'The Scarlet Queen' to be seen as a true leader amongst the Coven. To achieve this, you need to recover the fabled Chalice of Blood which has been lost for countless centuries."

######## Ghouls

DED_Ghoul_School:0 "Send Those Ghouls to the Schools"
DED_Ghoul_School_desc:0 "Ghouls make up the majority of the residential population of Magehold and the Dread League. Despite outwards appearances, most ghouls retain the intellect they had whilst alive. But since times have changed, and with it the knowledge required to survive in it has as well. Ghoul education plans will be drafted and implemented by the council in Magehold. You can teach an old ghoul new tricks."

DED_Ghoul_Union:0 "A Ghoul's Workers' Union"
DED_Ghoul_Union_desc:0 "The ghouls of the Dread League wish to unite under a common interest and form a workers union. This would allow the ghouls of Magehold to come together on issues affecting them in the workplace and even approach other groups within the Dread League over concerns or trade agreements. Technically forming a faction themselves, they will need to appoint a representative to go before the council during meetings."

DED_Approach_Blood:0 "Ghouls Approach the Coven of Blood"
DED_Approach_Blood_desc:0 "The Worker's Union desires to approach the Coven of Blood to reach a trade agreement, as they wish to broker a deal with the cove that will benefit the ghouls that work in Coven-owned workplaces. The deal that is eventually brokered would benefit both parties as the ghouls will get access to the brain markets, and the Coven gets to enjoy a more efficient workforce in the factories they own."

DED_Approach_Bone:0 "Ghouls Approach the Society of Bones"
DED_Approach_Bone_desc:0 "For too long have the Society of Bones and their ilk have had power over the ghouls, as they are responsible for the creation of more ghouls. As a political entity, the GWU wishes to approach the Society to work out a mutually beneficial deal for both parties. The ghouls get to enjoy greater numbers, whilst the necromancers get more ghouls to work in their undead army and factories."

DED_Brain_Market:0 "The Brain Markets"
DED_Brain_Market_desc:0 "Following the agreement with the Coven, the GWU has gained access to the brain markets. The brain market is in a relatively secluded part of Magehold, to protect the grey matter from the elements due to the large variety of uses brains have. Ghouls can maintain the state of their slowly decaying brains through the consumption of this grey matter, as eating them stalls the process."

DED_Flesh_Market:0 "The Flesh Markets"
DED_Flesh_Market_desc:0 "Even though ghouls are undead beings, they still require satiating their physical needs. After their agreement with the Society, the GWU can now secure large quantities of flesh for its own ponies. Flesh isn't just sold separate like a commodity however, as corpses are also sold in this market. Following the agreement with the Society of Bones, necromancers are making ghouls out of corpses to fuel the workforce."

DED_Cool_Ghoul:0 "Cold on the Inside"
DED_Cool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Ghouls are dead ponies and griffons that most likely once lived happy lives, for some that was probably hundreds of years ago. Ghoul physiology is similar to that of which the ghoul was before he or she died, except for the fact that ghouls do not need to keep warm in the cold. To take advantage of this, we should start focusing the ghouls in our army towards more winter and mountainous combat roles."

DED_Brain_Train:0 "Putting our Brains on a Train"
DED_Brain_Train_desc:0 "Ghouls can be very ravenous people, and can consume large quantities of meat. Replacing meat with rationed cuts of brain matter will provide ghouls and zombies with a more sating food to consume on the field. This should allow more efficient management with supplies during long wars, as much the ghouls do not need to consume as much brain as they do flesh. This way the undead army has a way of staying ahead!"

DED_High_Ed:0 "The Ghoulish Institute"
DED_High_Ed_desc:0 "Our armies need training. The Council of the Dread League will implement plans to put together a training institute to further improve the potency of our soldiers. This training institute is much more efficient with their training drills, and is geared towards all forms of undead soldiers. Further plans may be drafted to introduce morale officers if army cohesion remains a problem."

DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul:0 "Factory Ghouls"
DED_Work_Tool_Ghoul_desc:0 "Not all ghouls are destined for the army or smarted jobs within the Dread Lague, some ghouls remain permanently handicapped as their brains have partially rotted. Their bodies will not go to waste however! Those who failed the ghoul education program can submit straight to the Ghoul's Workplace Initiative where every ghoul has a place in a factory, and where they work for the future of the League!"

DED_Spook_Regulate:0 "Ghoulish Regulations"
DED_Spook_Regulate_desc:0 "The Dread League is starting to feel the burden of not organising its internal structure. The Council wishes to change this and impose regulations on the League. It would curtail the consumption of food and other basic commodities, the Dread League would be more capable of developing its land with less factory space dedicated to the domestic needs of its people."

DED_Commisar_Ghoul:0 "A Very Ghoulish Commissar"
DED_Commisar_Ghoul_desc:0 "Our armies need stronger leadership in the field, so squads and regiments should be led by fearsome commissars trained by the Institute. With commissars in our armies, soldiers that work under them will surely follow orders. Commissars can lead by example, punishing those who refuse to fall in line and generally bring order to the less obedient ghouls and zombies."

######## Voodoo

DED_Voodoo_Cabal:0 "Approach the Uu't U'kra Voodoo Cabal"
DED_Voodoo_Cabal_desc:0 "We should entreat the ancient Zebrican Voodoo cabal which has survived on this peninsula for centuries. The time has come to gain the support of the Uu't U'kra tribe for the first time in the history of this continent. The Uu't U'kra zebra cannot refuse the offer we have for them. They just need to meet a few requirements to begin with."

DED_Who_Voodoo:0 "What to Do With the Voodoo"
DED_Who_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra Cabal cannot simply be forced to integrate with the main body of the Dread League in just a few weeks. We must decide on how to handle the Uu't U'kra as they can finally contribute to the Dread League. Voodoo magic will support Rosa Maledicta's dream, be it directly or indirectly."

DED_You_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo in Magehold"
DED_You_Voodoo_desc:0 "Some of the Uu't U'kra will go to Magehold, the tribal representative will join the Necromancer Council, joining the Society and Coven during the important meetings. From there onwards, the council will deliberate on how to best utilise the Uu't U'kra in the coming years. The tribal representative does not hold much sway over the council."

DED_We_Voodoo:0 "Voodoo in the Darkest Forest"
DED_We_Voodoo_desc:0 "The Uu't U'kra inhabits the Darkest Forest. Our recent contact with them has already benefited our army with more bodies for the undead war machine. When their dark magic saturates the land, it becomes more receptive towards necromantic and vampryric magic. The dead army will grow evermore."

DED_Shrunken_Head:0 "Voodoo Trophies"
DED_Shrunken_Head_desc:0 "We at the council are interested with commanding respect over the Uu't U'kra and other internal factions within the Dread League, as we wish to gain greater influence over the Dread Peninsula. Claiming the heads of several rivals would certainly send a message to those who would dare oppose the council, and give us more power over the Dread League."

DED_Bottle_Voodoo:0 "Zebra Potion Masters"
DED_Bottle_Voodoo_desc:0 "Zebra shamans are the most talented potion makers in the world. The Uu’t U'kra shamans are no different. They have long since incorporated voodoo into the art of brewing wild concoctions that can have many effects. Putting their skills to good use in the industrial and public sectors in Magehold may alleviate the pressure on our industry to allow it to meet the demands of our undead army."

DED_Equal_Evil:0 "Equality under Malevolence"
DED_Equal_Evil_desc:0 "Be they Skeleton, Lich, Vampire or Zebra, everypony shares the same one goal, conquest of the world and the defeat of the light. Every individual in the Dread League would be labelled as vile or evil by an outsider. So let our malevolence unite us, there will be enough world out there to share after we conquer it."

DED_Sailor:0 "Sailing Stripes"
DED_Sailor_desc:0 "The Zebra are natural sailors, and the voodoo cabal is no different. Building from ancient traditions and learning from the recent innovations and doctrines stolen from other nations, the zebra will learn how to sail with a modern navy. To incorporate the Uu't U'kra as our navy, we must also construct the shipyards necessary to facilitate the existence of the Dread Armada."

DED_Sail_Salty_Sea:0 "The Dread Armada Sails the Salty Seas"
DED_Sail_Salty_Sea_desc:0 "Even with the best efforts of the council, our navy remains outdated. We must push the zebra cabal into designing a ship for the armada. Without a proper navy, our fleet is surely to be washed beneath the waves."

 deadempire.1.t:0 "The Empire of the Dead"
 deadempire.1.d:0 "The Dread League is little more than a collection of necromancers who live on the fringes of society. They have little industry or technology save ancient magic and outdated factories. Officially the lands of the Dread League are owned by the Arcturian Order, and have been for centuries. The knights however, know better. After the fall of the Empire of Undeath, the Dread League endures on the fringes of society. The ancient dark magics of the world will always tempt the curious, as they have now. An evil unknown calling has brought together necromancers from across the globe to the very spot where the Empire of Undeath was defeated long ago. The frozen north. There they gather to form the necromancer's council for the time is right to choose a leader to guide them on a path to world conquest once again. The ancient dead stir. Will the mortals be ready to face the oncoming tide?"
 deadempire.1.a:0 "There is much work to do..."
 
 deadempire.2.t:0 "The Queen of the Dead!"
 deadempire.2.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta emerges from the ruins a changed mare. Her eyes glisten with a bright spark and her body throbs with arcane energy. She seems taller than before, and radiates with an unholy beauty. Gone is sickly appearence and her naieve grasp of necromancy. With her newfound power, she is now truly worthy of her title of Queen of the Dead and ready to cleanse the filth of the living from this world."
 deadempire.2.a:0 "Tremble mortals and despair!"
 
 deadempire.3.t:0 "The Quest for the Chalice"
 deadempire.3.d:0 "In order to solidify her rule as Queen of the Dead, Rosa Maledicta must embark on a quest to find an ancient unholy artefact. The chalice of blood. Said to give the barer unspeakable power over the dead. She has cast spells and researched long into he cold nights and has finally uncovered its location. The journey will be trecherous, her resolve will be tested. But if she succeeds, she will be the undisbuted ruler of the Dread League."
 deadempire.3.a:0 "The Chalice will be mine!"
 
 deadempire.4.t:0 "The Door, and the Riddle"
 deadempire.4.d:0 "Rosa Maledicta and her undead thralls travelled long into the night, finally coming upon an ancient set of ruins of the old Dread Empire. As the necromancer approaches the ruins, they shift and move, sensing her presence. After a moment the ruins seem to part to reveal a dark stone door, engraved with the face of a skull. Curious, she steps closer only to realise the face is animated and moving. 'There is but one surity. One purpose. One peace. One outcome. One truth. Of what do I speak?"
 deadempire.4.a:0 "Why death... of course."

 deadempire.5.t:0 "The Chalice"
 deadempire.5.d:0 "The door chuckles in amusement before opening for Rosa Maledicta to a large domed room shrouded in darkness. The very air is thick with the smell of black magic, and in the centre of it all is the prize. A single beam of light projects from the ceiling down to a silver cup, filled with a coppery red liquid. Rosa Maledicta walks forward triumphantly and drinks from the chalice!"
 deadempire.5.a:0 "Yes! More power! More!"
 
 deadempirenews.1.t:0 "The Dead Rise!"
 deadempirenews.1.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, from the frozen north. Disturbing reports of skeletons and zombies surging forth to fall onto the defenses of the Arcturian Order started to come in by the droves. Early intellegence suggests that there is thick fighting on both sides. The world holds its breath as they well know, the Arcturian Order is the only thing standing between them and the hated undead."
 deadempirenews.1.a:0 "Let us purge this wreched world!"
 deadempirenews.1.b:0 "Man the defenses!"
 deadempirenews.1.c:0 "A troubling development"
 deadempirenews.1.e:0 "We shall watch with amusement"
 deadempirenews.1.f:0 "Let us hope for the best"
 deadempirenews.1.g:0 "How entertaining"
 
 deadempirenews.2.t:0 "The Black Crusade"
 deadempirenews.2.d:0 "Letters carried by carrion birds were dropped in every major city in the world today. The message was a simple one. In an act of what some are describing as utter insanity, Rosa Maledicta of the Dread League has declared war on every living being on the planet. Her only demand? That everyone should die and become her undead thrall. Our official response was..."
 deadempirenews.2.a:0 "...to march on the living!"
 deadempirenews.2.b:0 "... to alert high command."
 deadempirenews.2.c:0 "...Perhaps we can strike a deal..."
 deadempirenews.2.e:0 "... that we have other priorities right now."
 deadempirenews.2.f:0 "...who does this, Rosa Maledicta, think she is?!"



 deadempirenews.2.d:0 "The dread league have declared war against everyone"
