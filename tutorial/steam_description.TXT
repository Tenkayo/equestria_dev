[h1] 1.0 "Knights and Flowers" [/h1]
At last, Equestria at War team is proud to present the biggest update of the mod: "Knights and Flowers".

The most significant feature of the update is the Griffon Continent, a vast landmass to the east from Equestria, largely populated by the griffons. Various factions will fight for their right to exist or to restore the old borders. Griffon Empire, Aquiliean Republic, Kingdom of Wingbardy, Barony of Rumare, Skyfall Trade Federation and so much more to choose from. The griffons in the update will have their custom race technology tree, allowing for more ways to shape your army and society. The new "Development" system will make your life much harder as a minor. Struggling with famines, poverty and illiteracy, you will have to lead your griffon nation through these hard times.

The Equestrian continent also wasn't forgotten.
Brand new Solar Empire storyline is now open for you to explore, it includes various paths for Celestia's personality as Daybreaker, complicated event chains and the best world conquest experience. The Celestial State, that appears during the civil war against Nightmare Moon, will also carry the light of the sun to every corner of the jungles.
Changelings are now able to adpot Thorax's Practical Theory of Friendship and become harmonic at last! Now be careful not to accidentally bring fieldmarshal Trimmel to power after you remove Queen Chrysalis.
The Pinguins with their new focus tree are going to show to the world what they're made of.
The Buffalo have very limited ways to develop, seeing them being stuck within Equestria, however, with the new focus tree under certain circumstances, they might as well play their role in your history.
Yakistan and Jaki-Clan are going to have their own trees as well, right?
